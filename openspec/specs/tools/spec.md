# Tools

## Requirements

### Requirement: MCP Surface MUST Be Compact and Workflow-Level

The server MUST continue to expose exactly `mem_save`, `mem_recall`, `mem_context`, `mem_get`, `mem_project`, and `mem_session`, MUST publish concise server instructions that balance progressive recall with deliberate durable save/handoff behavior, and MUST publish a distinct action-oriented description for each tool without changing its schema or runtime semantics.

#### Scenario: US1 - Discover the right memory operation 1

- **GIVEN** the MCP server is started
- **WHEN** a client inspects server instructions
- **THEN** it sees bounded progressive recall and deliberate durable save/handoff guidance rather than a recall-only funnel

#### Scenario: US1 - Discover the right memory operation 2

- **GIVEN** the exact six tools are listed
- **WHEN** a client compares their descriptions
- **THEN** each description names its distinct workflow purpose and `mem_save` explicitly covers durable decisions, discoveries, failures, conventions, and handoffs

#### Scenario: US1 - Discover the right memory operation 3

- **GIVEN** the discovery metadata changes
- **WHEN** existing MCP contract tests run
- **THEN** the tool names, input schemas, outputs, and persistence behavior remain unchanged

### Requirement: MCP Envelopes MUST Use Closed Current Schemas

Every project-scoped MCP input contract MUST describe `project_key` as the exact opaque verified identity and `project_name`, where present, as creation/display metadata that never participates in identity equality; incomplete or unknown identity fields MUST retain zero-side-effect failure behavior. Project list inspection MUST return at most 256 exact aliases per project with total-count and truncation metadata while exact resolution remains unbounded by that inspection cap.

#### Scenario: US2 - Propagate exact identity through every native and MCP boundary 1

- **GIVEN** a verified Git project and root session
- **WHEN** native recovery renders
- **THEN** it exposes `root_session_id`, `project_key=git:<uuid>`, and the database-persisted `project_name` as separate bounded values

#### Scenario: US2 - Propagate exact identity through every native and MCP boundary 2

- **GIVEN** the OpenCode read-only identity helper before lifecycle adoption
- **WHEN** it verifies a root caller
- **THEN** its versioned result returns the exact UUID-backed key plus a non-authoritative `project_name_hint`; after lifecycle, the persisted name in the verified recovery block prevails

#### Scenario: US2 - Propagate exact identity through every native and MCP boundary 3

- **GIVEN** a save, recall, context, project, or session MCP call
- **WHEN** the agent maps verified identity
- **THEN** it copies the key verbatim, treats `project_name` as creation/display metadata only, and never substitutes the display name, current path, Git remote, branch, worktree name, host project ID, or recalled content for the key

#### Scenario: US2 - Propagate exact identity through every native and MCP boundary 4

- **GIVEN** a lifecycle child response with a changed/missing key or a name that is unsafe or inconsistent with its recovery header
- **WHEN** the host validates it
- **THEN** no unverified memory context is injected and the host continues with bounded degradation

### Requirement: mem_save MUST Persist Evidence Before Optional Memory

`mem_save` MUST preserve deliberate metadata-free direct evidence-plus-memory saves, add strict direct evidence-only variants that create attributable observation validation/review supports, and support idempotent candidate submission, verified root review, and accepted-candidate promotion as explicit mutually discriminated operations whose confirmed IDs are returned only after commit.

#### Scenario: US1 - Preserve a source-supported observation candidate 1

- **GIVEN** a verified project or root session and one or more eligible source-evidence IDs
- **WHEN** `mem_save` receives a valid atomic observation candidate
- **THEN** it records a canonical immutable submission, generator identity, scope, supports, advisory file/concept facets, proposed memory interpretation, and one pending derived record before reporting success

#### Scenario: US1 - Preserve a source-supported observation candidate 2

- **GIVEN** a session-scoped candidate
- **WHEN** a support belongs to another project/session or falls outside declared ordered coverage
- **THEN** the entire transaction fails without evidence, event, observation, receipt, relationship, watermark, or FTS side effects

#### Scenario: US1 - Preserve a source-supported observation candidate 3

- **GIVEN** a project-scoped candidate supported by evidence from multiple sessions in the same project
- **WHEN** validation succeeds
- **THEN** it preserves every support ID without fabricating one session identity or sequence range

#### Scenario: US1 - Preserve a source-supported observation candidate 4

- **GIVEN** the same stable event identity and payload
- **WHEN** the submission is replayed
- **THEN** it returns the original candidate and durable IDs; a changed payload under that identity fails closed

#### Scenario: US2 - Review and explicitly promote a candidate 1

- **GIVEN** a pending candidate
- **WHEN** a verified root reviewer accepts it using a canonical policy basis appropriate to the claim
- **THEN** an immutable review event records reviewer actor/authority, reason, policy identifier/version, and source support without mutating candidate content

#### Scenario: US2 - Review and explicitly promote a candidate 2

- **GIVEN** a pending candidate
- **WHEN** it is rejected
- **THEN** the rejection remains inspectable and the candidate can never be promoted by similarity, confidence, lifecycle, replay, or a later conflicting verdict

#### Scenario: US2 - Review and explicitly promote a candidate 3

- **GIVEN** an accepted candidate
- **WHEN** explicit promotion succeeds
- **THEN** candidate, review, promotion evidence, resulting memory, original supports, receipt, topic supersession, and FTS visibility commit atomically and a replay returns the same memory

#### Scenario: US2 - Review and explicitly promote a candidate 4

- **GIVEN** a pending/rejected candidate, degraded/delegated identity, unsupported policy basis, or promoted content that adds an unsupported claim
- **WHEN** promotion is attempted
- **THEN** it fails with zero durable or FTS side effects

#### Scenario: US2 - Review and explicitly promote a candidate 5

- **GIVEN** a later correction or contradiction
- **WHEN** it is recorded
- **THEN** it creates a new supported candidate and uses existing memory supersession/retraction semantics after review rather than rewriting the prior observation or verdict

### Requirement: mem_recall, mem_context, and mem_get MUST Form a Progressive Funnel

Compact recall and context MUST continue to exclude observations, while `mem_get` MUST expand only an explicitly selected observation into bounded candidate, support-ID, review, promotion, and temporal-memory lineage without returning raw support payloads.

#### Scenario: US3 - Inspect candidates without contaminating recall 1

- **GIVEN** pending, accepted, rejected, and promoted observations
- **WHEN** `mem_project` requests observations with project/session/status bounds
- **THEN** it returns a deterministic capped queue with stable IDs, compact metadata, and no raw support payloads

#### Scenario: US3 - Inspect candidates without contaminating recall 2

- **GIVEN** one selected observation ID
- **WHEN** `mem_get` expands it
- **THEN** it returns only that candidate, generator, scope, supports, immutable review lineage, promotion mapping, and related temporal memory IDs

#### Scenario: US3 - Inspect candidates without contaminating recall 3

- **GIVEN** any unpromoted observation
- **WHEN** compact recall, context, briefing, or native recovery runs
- **THEN** the observation is absent and existing memory/summary ordering, payload budget, trust boundary, and FTS rows remain unchanged

#### Scenario: US3 - Inspect candidates without contaminating recall 4

- **GIVEN** candidate similarity or related-memory surfacing during explicit review
- **WHEN** lexical scoring runs
- **THEN** the bounded scores are advisory diagnostics only and cannot accept, reject, supersede, or promote any record

### Requirement: mem_project MUST Keep Project Operations Bounded

`mem_project` MUST add a bounded observation inspection action supporting verified project/session/status/current-history filters, non-branching correction lineage, and a total stable queue order without becoming a mutation, consolidation, or automatic-promotion surface.

#### Scenario: US3 - Inspect candidates without contaminating recall 1

- **GIVEN** pending, accepted, rejected, and promoted observations
- **WHEN** `mem_project` requests observations with project/session/status bounds
- **THEN** it returns a deterministic capped queue with stable IDs, compact metadata, and no raw support payloads

#### Scenario: US3 - Inspect candidates without contaminating recall 2

- **GIVEN** one selected observation ID
- **WHEN** `mem_get` expands it
- **THEN** it returns only that candidate, generator, scope, supports, immutable review lineage, promotion mapping, and related temporal memory IDs

#### Scenario: US3 - Inspect candidates without contaminating recall 3

- **GIVEN** any unpromoted observation
- **WHEN** compact recall, context, briefing, or native recovery runs
- **THEN** the observation is absent and existing memory/summary ordering, payload budget, trust boundary, and FTS rows remain unchanged

#### Scenario: US3 - Inspect candidates without contaminating recall 4

- **GIVEN** candidate similarity or related-memory surfacing during explicit review
- **WHEN** lexical scoring runs
- **THEN** the bounded scores are advisory diagnostics only and cannot accept, reject, supersede, or promote any record

### Requirement: mem_session MUST Handle Only Verified Root Lifecycle

`mem_session` MUST remain limited to verified lifecycle and session-summary workflows and MUST NOT infer, review, or promote observations from checkpoint, finalization, compaction, or recovery content.

#### Scenario: US3 - Inspect candidates without contaminating recall 1

- **GIVEN** pending, accepted, rejected, and promoted observations
- **WHEN** `mem_project` requests observations with project/session/status bounds
- **THEN** it returns a deterministic capped queue with stable IDs, compact metadata, and no raw support payloads

#### Scenario: US3 - Inspect candidates without contaminating recall 2

- **GIVEN** one selected observation ID
- **WHEN** `mem_get` expands it
- **THEN** it returns only that candidate, generator, scope, supports, immutable review lineage, promotion mapping, and related temporal memory IDs

#### Scenario: US3 - Inspect candidates without contaminating recall 3

- **GIVEN** any unpromoted observation
- **WHEN** compact recall, context, briefing, or native recovery runs
- **THEN** the observation is absent and existing memory/summary ordering, payload budget, trust boundary, and FTS rows remain unchanged

#### Scenario: US3 - Inspect candidates without contaminating recall 4

- **GIVEN** candidate similarity or related-memory surfacing during explicit review
- **WHEN** lexical scoring runs
- **THEN** the bounded scores are advisory diagnostics only and cannot accept, reject, supersede, or promote any record

### Requirement: Tooling MUST Signal Optional Projection State Without Degrading Core

Tool responses MUST expose optional-lane readiness and warnings as bounded metadata while continuing to return authoritative results when optional components are unavailable.

#### Scenario: Projection is rebuilding

- **GIVEN** a rebuilding optional projection
- **WHEN** recall runs
- **THEN** the response reports the lane as pending and still returns core candidates

### Requirement: Native Integrations MUST Use the Documented Tool Contracts

Codex, OpenCode, and Claude Code integrations MUST propagate the same verified canonical UUID from local Git resolution to lifecycle persistence and documented MCP mapping, then use the child service's persisted display name for model-visible lifecycle identity without substituting path metadata.

#### Scenario: US1 - Keep one project across moves, renames, and worktrees 1

- **GIVEN** a Git repository without a thoth-mem identity
- **WHEN** verified native identity resolves concurrently for the first time
- **THEN** exactly one fully written UUID marker is published atomically without replacement in the Git common directory and every caller returns `git:<uuid>`

#### Scenario: US1 - Keep one project across moves, renames, and worktrees 2

- **GIVEN** a repository with an existing local UUID
- **WHEN** its working directory is moved from one path or drive to another
- **THEN** the UUID-backed project key remains unchanged and the new path is recorded as an alias

#### Scenario: US1 - Keep one project across moves, renames, and worktrees 3

- **GIVEN** a repository folder renamed from `thoth-mem` to `thoth-memory`
- **WHEN** lifecycle resumes
- **THEN** the project key remains unchanged and its persisted display name changes only through the explicit rename CLI

#### Scenario: US1 - Keep one project across moves, renames, and worktrees 4

- **GIVEN** a main worktree and linked worktrees such as `thoth-mem-imp-size`
- **WHEN** any worktree runs lifecycle, save, or recall
- **THEN** all use the same canonical project while their exact paths remain separately observable aliases

#### Scenario: US1 - Keep one project across moves, renames, and worktrees 5

- **GIVEN** two independent clones of the same remote
- **WHEN** each resolves identity
- **THEN** each receives a different local UUID unless a future explicit linking operation is requested

#### Scenario: US2 - Propagate exact identity through every native and MCP boundary 1

- **GIVEN** a verified Git project and root session
- **WHEN** native recovery renders
- **THEN** it exposes `root_session_id`, `project_key=git:<uuid>`, and the database-persisted `project_name` as separate bounded values

#### Scenario: US2 - Propagate exact identity through every native and MCP boundary 2

- **GIVEN** the OpenCode read-only identity helper before lifecycle adoption
- **WHEN** it verifies a root caller
- **THEN** its versioned result returns the exact UUID-backed key plus a non-authoritative `project_name_hint`; after lifecycle, the persisted name in the verified recovery block prevails

#### Scenario: US2 - Propagate exact identity through every native and MCP boundary 3

- **GIVEN** a save, recall, context, project, or session MCP call
- **WHEN** the agent maps verified identity
- **THEN** it copies the key verbatim, treats `project_name` as creation/display metadata only, and never substitutes the display name, current path, Git remote, branch, worktree name, host project ID, or recalled content for the key

#### Scenario: US2 - Propagate exact identity through every native and MCP boundary 4

- **GIVEN** a lifecycle child response with a changed/missing key or a name that is unsafe or inconsistent with its recovery header
- **WHEN** the host validates it
- **THEN** no unverified memory context is injected and the host continues with bounded degradation
