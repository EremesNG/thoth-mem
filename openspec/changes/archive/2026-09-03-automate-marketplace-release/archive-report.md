# Archive Report: Automate Marketplace Release Publication

**Status**: ARCHIVED<br>
**Oracle verdict**: PASS<br>
**Archive path**: `openspec/changes/archive/2026-09-03-automate-marketplace-release/`

## Completed scope

- US1 / FR-001 / FR-003 / SC-001 / SC-003: a successful tag release now mints a repository-scoped GitHub App token and invokes the existing validated publisher only after npm and GitHub release publication.
- US2 / FR-002 / SC-002 / SC-003: local semantic-version commands no longer compete with CI, while the idempotent manual marketplace retry remains.

## Verification lineage

- `verify-report.md` records independent Oracle PASS with executed evidence for every FR and buildable SC and an explicit residual RISK for outcome SC-004.
- Root verification passed the 5-test release suite, 52 files / 434 full-suite tests, build, integration inventory, packed smoke, fixture benchmark, prepublish, and diff hygiene.

## Canonical specification sync

- Updated: `release-publishing`.
## Deviations and residual warnings

- SC-004 remains unobserved until the next real tag release exercises the App installation and cross-repository push.
- `actionlint` was unavailable; the workflow passed its focused repository contract and exact independent static inspection.
- `actions/create-github-app-token@v3` is a mutable major-version reference consistent with the approved reference implementation.
- The benchmark command refreshed environment-dependent report values; the generated report was restored so no unrelated output remains.

## Follow-up

- Observe the next real `v*.*.*` release and confirm one bot update or an already-current result in `thoth-plugins/main` without a maintainer-run publication command.
